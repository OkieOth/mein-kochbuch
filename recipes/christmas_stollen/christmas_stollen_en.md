# General

A simple recipe for Christmas stollen. The original comes from my mother-in-law Helga. Over the years, I’ve probably optimized the recipe a bit, but so far, no one has complained about the results at Christmas x-D  

Since the stollen should rest for at least 14 days after baking, it’s best to bake it on the first Sunday of Advent to be prepared for the holidays.  

The following recipe includes the ingredients for one stollen, but when I bake, I usually make two stollens at the same time.  


# Ingredients

* 500g type 550 flour  
* 100g candied lemon peel  
* 100g grated almonds  
* 200g raisins  
* 50ml rum  
* 1/4 tsp cardamom (optional)  
* 1/4 tsp ground mace (optional)  
* 1/2 tsp salt  
* 150–180ml milk  
* 50g fresh yeast  
* 125g butter  
* 40g clarified butter (in the past, lard was used)  
* 90g margarine  
* 100g sugar  
* 8g vanilla sugar  
* Zest of half an organic lemon, grated  


# Preparation  

## Day Before Baking  
1. Put the raisins in a glass bowl, pour in the rum, and let them soak overnight.  

## Baking Day  
1. Grate the lemon zest.  
2. Chop the candied lemon peel into smaller pieces.  
3. Soften the butter and margarine.  
4. Bring the milk to room temperature.  
5. Place all ingredients except the raisins into a mixing bowl.  
6. Let the mixture sit briefly to activate the yeast.  
7. Use a stand mixer to knead the dough thoroughly.  
8. Let the dough rest for 2 hours.  
9. Add the raisins to the dough and knead again.  
10. Allow the dough to rest for another hour.  
11. Knead the dough by hand, then place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  
12. Shape the stollen into its traditional form. Remove or press in any exposed raisins. Tuck any extra raisins under the dough’s edge. By the end, there should be no raisins visible on the surface, as they might dry out during baking.  
13. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes.  
14. Preheat the oven to 200°C (top and bottom heat). Place a dish of water in the oven.  
15. Bake the stollen at 160°C for 60 minutes (second rack from the bottom or middle rack).  
16. When the stollen is nicely browned, take it out of the oven and brush it generously with melted butter (about 80g – more won’t hurt x-D).  
17. While still warm, wrap the stollen in parchment paper, then in aluminum foil.  
18. Once the stollen has cooled, place it in a plastic bag, seal it airtight, and store it.  

... Now, let it sit until Christmas, even if it’s hard to resist! :D  


# Comments  

If the dough is too moist, it may spread during baking. For this reason, I either “pinch” the raw dough into shape, bake it in a mold (nobody at home likes that), or just live with a flatter stollen ;-)  

I’ve adjusted the quantities over time to fit standard package sizes. All in all, it’s a forgiving recipe, leaving plenty of room for experimentation.
