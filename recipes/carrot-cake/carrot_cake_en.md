# Comments

I've also baked the cake with 280 g of carrots. I'm basically curious how much more I can increase the carrot content. For the topping, it's important that it tastes slightly tangy in the end. Even using a slightly saltier cream cheese didn't result in a worse outcome.

The cake stays fresh in the fridge for at least 4 days.
